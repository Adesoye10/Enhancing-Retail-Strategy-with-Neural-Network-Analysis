ANN Analysis for Online Retail Data
Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, to forecast sales for an online retail dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
Prerequisites

Before you can run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:

    Python 3.x
    Keras
    TensorFlow
    Pandas
    scikit-learn
    Matplotlib

These dependencies can be installed via pip:

bash

pip install tensorflow keras pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

Installation

Clone this repository to get started with the analysis:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/ann-analysis-online-retail.git
cd ann-analysis-online-retail

Usage

    Open the Jupyter Notebook environment of your choice:

bash

jupyter notebook

or

bash

jupyter lab

    Navigate to the Adeoye_ANN_Analysis_.ipynb notebook.

    Execute the notebook cells in sequence to view the analysis and results.

Data

The dataset used in this notebook is an Excel file containing online retail data. It should be formatted properly to match the preprocessing steps described in the notebook.
